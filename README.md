# JobBrander [Jobs Common](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-common) Demo

This project serves as an example of incorporating several of 
JobBrander's job board api clients into a PHP project. This
demo uses the [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/) Framework, 
but the concepts should hold true in any project using 
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies.

# Job Board API Demo

This project serves as an example of incorporating several of the
[Jobs Common](https://github.com/JobBrander/jobs-common) 
job board api clients into a PHP project. This
demo uses the [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/) Framework, 
but the concepts should hold true in any project using 
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies.

## What is the Jobs Common project?

It's an open source attempt at standardizing the responses
given by job board APIs in PHP. In other words, it provides
a simple interface for getting jobs from job boards.

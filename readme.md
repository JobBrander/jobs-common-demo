# Job Search API Client Demo Project

This demo project was set up to show an example implementation of the Job Search
API Clients I've been working on lately.

## Application description

The home page shows a job search field much like you'd see on any of the job
search sites. The difference is that you can select the API you want to search.

If you put a keyword into the box and you've set up the application correctly,
you should see results like so:

## Setup

- Download this repo and run `composer install` to get the latest versions of the
job search clients.

- Rename the .env.example file .env and fill in the corresponding api keys and
required publisher ids.

- Run `php artisan serve` and navigate to your local server to see the project
in action.
